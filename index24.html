    <h1>Mini Bio</h1>
    <p>My name is Omyah Royals...obviously. I'm a 16 year old virgo that participates in a lot of activities and has a love for Harry Potter.</p>

<h2>Nays</h2>
<p>Like any other human on this earth, there are many things that I dislike for many different reasons. A few of these things would include reptiles, peanuts, grapefruit, and a list of many other things that can go on for a thousand years.</p>

<h3>Yays</h3>
<p>Although there happen to be many things in which I dislike, I also have a contradicting point of view. Some of the things I like to do would be computer coding, math, dancing, and playing/watchimg sports. There are different types of sports that i find an interest in playing such as softball, competetive cheerleading, and my favorite sport to play is tennis. I enjoy watching basketball and tennis.</p>
